You have to decompress the .zip file into your /resources directory, as a resource.
When it's done, open 'loader.lua' file and set modelIDs of models.


FOR EXAMPLE: if you want to load the model to an infernus
- Just replace default zeros to 411, which is the modelID of infernus.

local files = {
	{ "infernus.txd", 411 },
	{ "infernus.dff", 411 },
}
